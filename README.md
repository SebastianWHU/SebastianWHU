Hi there ğŸ‘‹
I'm Sebastian Urs StÃ¼mpfle, an entrepreneur passionate about innovation and growth. During my time studying Business Administration at the University of Liechtenstein, I founded e-commerce brands that have generated substantial eight-figure revenues. My professional journey has taken me through building S&F Vertriebs- und Handels GmbH, where we specialize in distributing household products through Amazon.

Here's a bit more about me:

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced strategies to optimize e-commerce growth and improve product distribution across different markets.
ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on disruptive startups that challenge industry norms and offer innovative solutions.
